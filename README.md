## Overview
I have created a quiz, in which you have 60 seconds to answer 5 questions, this will record your score and show you on the leaderboard. If a question is answered wrong this will also deduct 10 seconds from the time.

## Installation
In order to use this application, you will need to open it in the browser. You will then need to click the "Start" button or the "High Scores" button.
If you press the "Start" You will then be presented with the quiz, this will take you through a series of questions, if one is answered correctly you will gain a point, if it is incorrect you will lose 10 seconds from your time. If you do not finish in time, the quiz will automatically finish. If you finish before the time this will also take you to the next screen. Here you are able to enter your name and save and you will be taken to the high scores list. You can either play again or go home from here.
If you click "High Scores" this will take you to the highscores list.

## Features
This quiz features a simple, easy layout that means you can either play the quiz or look at the high scores, or you can do so after playing the quiz. The quiz features multiple choice options that are highlighted when you hover over them and once clicked show you if they are correct or incorrect using colours. There is also a timer showing you how much time is remaining, which will also go down if answered incorrectly. The bar at the top tracks how far you are through the questions. The score element keeps track of the amount of questions you have answered correctly and this also holds this number for when you finish the quiz and you go to the next page. On this page you are able to enter a name and keep your high score on saved to the leaderboard. From here you are able to either play again or go home.
